# Issue workflow

This concept tells you how to record, find and close an issue. An issue records one problem or one task.

## Find issues

* Open issues: `okfw search --kind issue --tag open`
* Closed issues: `okfw search --kind issue --tag resolved`
* Issues for one feature: `okfw search --kind issue --tag open --tag nodejs`

## Record an issue

1. Search the wiki for the problem. If an issue exists, update that issue.
2. Create the concept in `issues/` with the tags `issue` and `open`.
3. Set `type: issue` and `kind: issue`.
4. Write the body with the sections below.
5. Link the issue to the concepts that it affects, for example a feature or a component.
6. Add a link to the issue from the [issues overview](/issues/issues-overview--01a1837af732.md).

## Body sections

```markdown
## Problem
What is wrong, or what is necessary. One paragraph.

## Context
Why it is important. What it affects. Evidence, with links.

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] One check that shows the issue is closed.

## Related
- [Concept](/bundle/file.md)
```

## Close an issue

1. Add a `## Resolution` section. Give the date, the commit or PR, and what changed.
2. Replace the tag `open` with `resolved`.
3. Run `okfw set-lifecycle <id> deprecated`.

Do not delete a closed issue. Other concepts and commit messages refer to it.
