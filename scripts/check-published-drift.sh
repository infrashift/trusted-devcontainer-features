# Compare each feature's source against the bytes already published under its
# declared version, and refuse to let them silently differ.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#
# `devcontainer features publish` skips any version tag that already exists in
# the target namespace. Under the staged release that namespace is STAGING, and
# staging persists between runs, so two things follow that this repository had
# no check for:
#
#   1. A source change without a version bump is dropped on the floor. Staging
#      still holds the old bytes under that version, publish says "already
#      exists, skipping", review inspects the old bytes, and promotion ships
#      them again. The release log reports success.
#
#   2. The first run against an EMPTY staging namespace republishes everything,
#      including features whose source has not changed. The feature tarball is
#      not byte-reproducible, so identical source produces a new digest -- and
#      because every dependent pins bootstrap BY DIGEST, a re-minted bootstrap
#      re-pins all of them. Consumers that pin features by digest then hold a
#      mix of two bootstraps and install both. This happened on 2026-09-10.
#
# Both are the same question asked at different times: is the source tree the
# same bytes as what is published under this version?
#
#   --check   (pr-gate, make check)  production has :<version> and it differs
#                                    from src/<feature>  ->  error, bump the version
#   --seed    (release, stage jobs)  production has :<version> and it is
#                                    identical  ->  copy those exact bytes into
#                                    staging so publish skips them and the
#                                    digest cannot change; it differs -> error
#
# THE COMPARISON NORMALISES ONE THING
#
# Source declares "./bootstrap"; published bytes declare the production
# reference with a digest. The comparison rewrites the source copy with the
# digest the PUBLISHED artifact carries, so the only differences that remain
# are real edits. A bootstrap digest that moved is not drift here -- that is
# check-bootstrap-fanout.sh's question, and it requires a version bump, which
# makes the artifact absent rather than different.
#
# In --seed mode the trees under BASE_DIR have already been rewritten with the
# production bootstrap digest, so they are compared as they are.
#
# Required env (--seed): FEATURES (JSON list) STAGING_NAMESPACE BASE_DIR
#                        GITHUB_REPOSITORY, and a docker login that can push
#                        to staging (crane reads it). DRY_RUN=1 reports the
#                        copies it would make and pushes nothing.
# Required env (--check): none. GITHUB_REPOSITORY defaults to this repository.
