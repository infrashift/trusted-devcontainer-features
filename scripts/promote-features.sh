# Promote reviewed features from the staging namespace to production, by digest.
#
# WHY BY DIGEST
#
# The verdict names a digest per feature. Copying that digest is what makes the
# review binding: the bytes promoted are the bytes inspected, not "whatever is
# in staging now". Re-resolving the tag here would reopen exactly the gap the
# staging split closes -- a build actor could push again between review and
# promotion and ship something nobody looked at.
#
# THE VERDICT SIGNATURE IS CHECKED FIRST
#
# The verdict is produced by the review actor and signed with the review key.
# This job holds the release key, not the review key, so it cannot forge one.
# Verification against the committed public half is the gate; everything after
# it is mechanical.
#
# Required env: GITHUB_REPOSITORY
# Optional env: VERDICT (default staging-verdict.json)
#               REVIEW_PUB (default .github/pdp/public-keys/review.pub)
#               DRY_RUN=1  verify and report, copy nothing
